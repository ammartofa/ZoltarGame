# ZoltarGame
This is a game that I built in 2021 as part of my submission for the Create Task section of the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. It is based on Zoltar an animatronic fortune-telling machine. It was built utilizing Code.org's JavaScript-based App Lab. 
Players pick a random fortune that is displayed from a database and the fortune is displayed in an appealing format for the player. There is also a minigame which requires the player to find and click on an object that Zoltar lost.
